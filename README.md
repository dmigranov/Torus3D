# SphEll3D

A library for visualizing scenes in three-dimensional spherical and elliptical spaces. Created using the Direct3D 11 API and the [DirectX Tool Kit](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTK).

You can add meshes to the spaces and apply textures to them. You can also add parent meshes and add updaters so that meshes' positions on the scene will be updated.

GameExample is an example project built with the library.

# Some images and GIFs

![Eight same-sized textured objects in three-dimensional elliptical space, fog effect](/fig1.png)
*Demonstration of fog effect and geometrical and optical properties of the three-dimensional elliptical space; the eight objects pictured are actually same-sized, their apparent size changes differently compared to the ordinary Euclidean space.*
