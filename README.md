# SphEll3D

A library for visualizing scenes in three-dimensional spherical and elliptical spaces. Created using the Direct3D 11 API and the [DirectX Tool Kit](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTK) (for handling user input and drawing text; you need to have its headers and link with it to build the library).

GameExample is an example project.
